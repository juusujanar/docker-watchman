# Facebook's Watchman in Docker

[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman) is a file watching tool built by Facebook.
It is used for watching files for changes and triggering events when a change is detected.

These images can be used as base image for your development environment. Or be creative and
use it how you prefer.

Currently images are only available for amd64, but other platforms will follow soon.
